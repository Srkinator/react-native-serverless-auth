# Fullstack Serverless Auth Project
This is a Client + Server Side Signup/Signin Authentication project. I'm showing the way how to authenticate a user via his phone number and code received in SMS message, consumed by mobile application created in React Native.
```
Client: Simple React Native app with a sign in/sign up screen.
```
```
Server(less): Create/Save users and generated sign in codes in firebase database using Google Cloud Functions or AWS Lambda Functions
```
